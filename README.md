# pureharm
New, better, iteration of our `busymachines-commons` â€” short for "pure harmony"

Currently the project is under heavy development, and is mostly driven by company needs until a stable version can be put out. At the end of the day this is a principled utility library that provides all glue to make web server development a breeze. It encourages users to use the "pureharm" style, for each application creating, for instance, your own "myapp.effects" package, which is easily created by mixing in traits provided by pureharm + your own domain specific stuff.
